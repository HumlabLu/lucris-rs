  [Based on the provided context, the researchers in the department of computer science have conducted various AI-related research. Some of the notable research includes:

\* Kashyap Haresamudram, Stefan Larsson, and Fredrik Heintz proposed a holistic approach to AI transparency, which operates on three levels: Algorithmic Transparency, Interaction Transparency, and Social Transparency (Index: 1).

\* Stefan Larsson, Mikael Anneroth, Anna Felländer, Li Felländer-Tsai, Fredrik Heintz, and Rebecka Cedering Ångström conducted a report on the state of knowledge of ethical, social, and legal challenges related to artificial intelligence, proposing three recommendations for sustainable AI (Index: 2).

\* Maria Hedlund and Erik Persson researched the distribution of responsibility for AI development, highlighting the need for expert views on this matter (Index: 3).

\* Mattias Kärrholm, Annet Bakels, Tanja van der Laan, Karin Peeters, Jan van Weesep, Gordana Fontana Giusti, Nikolaos Koronis, Abdul Mohammed, Sergio Correa, Irene Aristeguieta, Hermes Andreu, Kayvan Karimi, Beatriz Campos, Noah Raford, Magda Mavridou, Ilaria Geddes, and others conducted research on computer models and analysis (Index: 4).

\* Jason Tucker, Virginia Dignum, Donal Casey, Frank Dignum, Andre Holzapfel, Ana Marusic, Yulia Razmetaeva, and others explored the growing influence of AI across diverse fields, advocating for meaningful interdisciplinary AI research (Index: 5).

\* Stefan Larsson analyzed the use of ethics guidelines as governance tools in the development and use of artificial intelligence, highlighting the challenges of temporal discrepancy between technological and legal change (Index: 6).

\* Maria Hedlund and Erik Persson researched expert responsibility in AI development (Index: 7).

\* Christian Balkenius, Ingar Brinck, Virginia Dignum, Francis Lee, Anna-Sara Lind, and Helena Lindgren argued for increased efforts on AI governance and research funding structures to address the potential dangers of large, generative models (Index: 8).

\* Kasia Söderlund analyzed the main stages of development of AI strategy in Poland, focusing on three significant documents and highlighting the importance of the ethical component in shaping the strategy (Index: 9).

These researchers have contributed to various aspects of AI research, including transparency, governance, responsibility, and the development of AI strategies.]
