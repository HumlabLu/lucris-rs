  title: [Answer],
  [Based on the provided context, I would recommend the research group led by Diederick C Niehorster, Marcus Nyström, and Roy S Hessels. This group has conducted extensive research in eye tracking, including the development of new methods and techniques, such as the "Grip" algorithm for compensating eye-tracker slippage, and the creation of a novel setup for recording large gaze shifts.

Additionally, this group has also worked on the validation of eye-tracking data quality, which is an essential aspect of gesture recognition research. Their research on the accuracy and precision of wearable eye-tracking recordings using a printable poster and accompanying Python software is particularly relevant to this area of study.

Furthermore, the group's expertise in eye tracking and gaze estimation, as well as their experience with working on projects that involve the development of new methods and techniques, make them a suitable choice for a research project on eye tracking and gesture recognition.
