        Researcher: Anthony Smoker,Irene  Buselli,Luca Oneto,Carlo  Dambra,Christian Verdonk Gallego,Miguel Garcia Martinez,Nnenna Ike,Tamara  Pejovic,Patricia Ruiz Martino. Research: Background: The air traffic management (ATM) system has historicallycoped with a global increase in traffic demand ultimately leading toincreased operational complexity.When dealing with the impact of this increasing complexity on systemsafety it is crucial to automatically analyse the losses of separation(LoSs) using tools able to extract meaningful and actionableinformation from safety reports.Current research in this field mainly exploits natural languageprocessing (NLP) to categorise the reports,with the limitations that theconsidered categories need to be manually annotated by experts andthat general taxonomies are seldom exploited.Methods: To address the current gaps,authors propose to performexploratory data analysis on safety reports combining state-of-the-arttechniques like topic modelling and clustering and then to develop analgorithm able to extract the Toolkit for ATM Occurrence Investigation(TOKAI) taxonomy factors from the free-text safety reports based onsyntactic analysis.TOKAI is a tool for investigation developed by EUROCONTROL and itstaxonomy is intended to become a standard and harmonisedapproach to future investigations.Results: Leveraging on the LoS events reported in the publicdatabases of the Comisi n de Estudio y An lisis de Notificaciones deIncidentes de Tr nsito A reo and the United Kingdom AirproxBoard,authors show how their proposal is able to automaticallyextract meaningful and actionable information from safetyreports,other than to classify their content according to the TOKAItaxonomy.The quality of the approach is also indirectly validated by checking theconnection between the identified factors and the main contributor ofthe incidents.Conclusions: Authors' results are a promising first step toward the fullautomation of a general analysis of LoS reports supported by resultson real-world data coming from two different sources.In the future,authors' proposal could be extended to othertaxonomies or tailored to identify factors to be included in the safetytaxonomies.KeywordsATM, Safety, Resilience, Natural Language Processing, Losses ofSeparation, Safety Reports, TOKAI

        Researcher: David Johnson. Research: Language policy and planning (LPP) is one of the fastest growing sub-disciplines of applied linguistics. This book is the first volume that is exclusively devoted to research methods in language policy. As in other areas of applied linguistics, LPP scholars have drawn upon an array of research methods from a range of disciplines. This book is designed as a practical roadmap for those methods.
    
        Researcher: Bengt Sigurd. Research: The Commentator is a small-scale computer implementation of a model oftext production. The system simulates human behavior from the perceptionof events on a screen to the utterances. It is designed to allow anyone havingsome knowledge of Basic and access to a microcomputer to study the semantics of words (e.g. localization and movement predicates such asapproach, left/right, near, in front of, turn, overtake), pronouns, and sentence connectives such as however, also. The system also allows experimentation with different text strategies and systems of speech production. The system has practical applications in automatic commentators, talking robots, and similar systems often referred to in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
    
        Researcher: Pierre M. Nugues. Research: Since the last edition of this book (2014), progress has been astonishing in all areas of Natural Language Processing, with recent achievements in Text Generation that spurred a media interest going beyond the traditional academic circles. Text Processing has meanwhile become a mainstream industrial tool that is used, to various extents, by countless companies. As such, a revision of this book was deemed necessary to catch up with the recent breakthroughs, and the author discusses models and architectures that have been instrumental in the recent progress of Natural Language Processing. As in the first two editions, the intention is to expose the reader to the theories used in Natural Language Processing, and to programming examples that are essential for a deep understanding of the concepts. Although present in the previous two editions, Machine Learning is now even more pregnant, having replaced many of the earlier techniques to process text. Many new techniques build on the availability of text. Using Python notebooks, the reader will be able to load small corpora, format text, apply the models through executing pieces of code, gradually discover the theoretical parts by possibly modifying the code or the parameters, and traverse theories and concrete problems through a constant interaction between the user and the machine. The data sizes and hardware requirements are kept to a reasonable minimum so that a user can see instantly, or at least quickly, the results of most experiments on most machines. The book does not assume a deep knowledge of Python, and an introduction to this language aimed at Text Processing is given in Ch. 2, which will enable the reader to touch all the programming concepts, including NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors as fundamental structures to represent and process numerical data in Python, or Keras for training Neural Networks to classify texts. Covering topics like Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech and Sequence Annotation, the textbook also gives an in-depth overview of Transformers (for instance, BERT), Self-Attention and Sequence-to-Sequence Architectures.</p>
    
        Researcher: Nele Pöldvere,Victoria Johansson,Carita Paradis. Research: This talk reports on the compilation of the new London–Lund Corpus (LLC–2) –a corpus of contemporary spoken British English, collected 2014–2019. The sizeand design of LLC–2 are the same as that of the world’s first corpus of spokenlanguage, namely the London–Lund Corpus (LLC–1), with spoken data mainlyfrom the 1960s. In addition to the fact that we have a corpus of contemporary speech, the existence of LLC–2 also gives researchers the opportunity to make principles diachronic comparisons of speech over the past 50 years and detect change in communicative behaviour among speakers.The compilation of LLC–2 has included a number of different stages such as data collection, transcription of the recordings, markup and annotation, and finally making the corpus accessible to the research community. The talk describes and critically examines the methodological decisions made in each stage. For example, it was important to strike a balance between LLC–2 as a representative collection of data of contemporary spoken English and its comparability to LLC–1. Therefore, both corpora contain the same speech situations (dialogue, mainly everyday face-to-face conversation, as well as monologue), but the specific recordings added to LLC–2 also reflect the technological advances of the last few decades, particularly with respect to speech situations such as telephone calls (e.g., Skype) and broadcast discussions and interviews (e.g., podcasts). Moreover, the transcriptions in LLC–2 are orthographic and time-aligned with the corresponding sound files, which is a feature of the corpus that is novel and makes it possible to, among other things, investigate prosody and dialogue management among speakers with great precision. The corpus, as well as metadata about the transcriptions and the speakers, will be released to the public in late 2019 from the Lund University Humanities Lab’s corpus server. The release will fill an unfortunate gap in the availability of spoken corpora for linguistic analysis. The benefits of spoken corpora in general and of LLC–2 in particular will be demonstrated in the talk through examples of case studies based on the corpus (e.g., Põldvere &amp; Paradis, 2019a, 2019b). The case studies illustrate how LLC–2 can contribute to our understanding of meaning-making and discursive practices in real communication and provide a window into the cognitive and social processes of dialogic interaction, both from a contemporary and a back-in-time perspective.
    
        Researcher: David Johnson. Research: The practice of language policy research
    
        Researcher: Oscar Kjell,Salvatore Giorgi. Research: The language that individuals use for expressing themselves contains rich psychological information. Recent significant advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL), namely transformers, have resulted in large performance gains in tasks related to understanding natural language. However, these state-of-the-art methods have not yet been made easily accessible for psychology researchers, nor designed to be optimal for human-level analyses. This tutorial introduces text (https://r-text.org/), a new R-package for analyzing and visualizing human language using transformers, the latest techniques from NLP and DL. The text-package is both a modular solution for accessing state-of-the-art language models and an end-to-end solution catered for human-level analyses. Hence, text provides user-friendly functions tailored to test hypotheses in social sciences for both relatively small and large data sets. The tutorial describes methods for analyzing text, providing functions with reliable defaults that can be used off-the-shelf as well as providing a framework for the advanced users to build on for novel pipelines. The reader learns about three core methods: (1) textEmbed(): to transform text to modern transformer-based word embeddings;(2) textTrain() and textPredict(): to train predictive models with embeddings as input, and use the models to predict from;(3) textSimilarity() and textDistance(): to compute semantic similarity/distance scores between texts.</p>
    
        Researcher: Richard Johansson. Research: Semantic roles, logical relations such as Agent or Instrument that hold between events and their participants and circumstances, need to be determined automatically by several types of applications in natural language processing. This process is referred to as semantic role labeling. This dissertation describes how to construct statistical models for semantic role labeling of English text, and how role semantics is related to surface syntax.
    
        Researcher: Anita Thomas. Research: Syntactic priming in second language corpus data—testing an experimental paradigm in corpus data
    
        Researcher: Anders Björkelund,Sameer Pradhan,Alessandro Moschitti,Nianwen Xue,Hwee Tou Ng,Olga Uryupina,Yuchen Zhang,Zhi Zhong. Research: Large-scale linguistically annotated corpora have played a crucial role in advancing the state of the art of key natural language technologies such as syntactic, semantic and discourse analyzers, and they serve as training data as well as evaluation benchmarks. Up till now, however, most of the evaluation has been done on monolithic corpora such as the Penn Treebank, the Proposition Bank. As a result, it is still unclear how the state-of-the-art analyzers perform in general on data from a variety of genres or domains. The completion of the OntoNotes corpus, a large-scale, multi-genre, multilingual corpus manually annotated with syntactic, semantic and discourse information, makes it possible to perform such an evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of the performance of publicly available, state-of-the-art tools on all layers and languages in the OntoNotes v5.0 corpus. This should set the benchmark for future development of various NLP components in syntax and semantics, and possibly encourage research towards an integrated system that makes use of the various layers jointly to improve overall performance
    
        Researcher: Inger Bierschenk. Research: To an ever-increasing extent, in scientific investigations of various kinds are data collected, which consists of verbal expressions. They may have been generated through verbal presentations, personal interviews, open questions or written accounts. Therefore, it is not unusual that an investigator is confronted with data collections that appear to be “unstructured” and of an extent that it seems to be an insurmountable task to extract the information content with so-called informal methods, like content analysis. However, those difficulties can be bridged over with a discussion of the function of language. But this would require a stance on a strategy that can cope with the cognitive ability of the individual information provider, i.e., to express an idea or an opinion, without loosing in formal capacity and stringency.
    
        Researcher: Johanna Berg,Sonja Aits,Carl Aasa,Björn Appelgren Thorell. Research: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a rich source of information for medical research and public health monitoring. Information systems based on EHR data could also assist in patient care and hospital management. However, much of the data in EHRs is in the form of unstructured text, which is difficult to process for analysis. Natural language processing (NLP), a form of artificial intelligence, has the potential to enable automatic extraction of information from EHRs and several NLP tools adapted to the style of clinical writing have been developed for English and other major languages. In contrast, the development of NLP tools for less widely spoken languages such as Swedish has lagged behind. A major bottleneck in the development of NLP tools is the restricted access to EHRs due to legitimate patient privacy concerns. To overcome this issue we have generated a citizen science platform for collecting artificial Swedish EHRs with the help of Swedish physicians and medical students. These artificial EHRs describe imagined but plausible emergency care patients in a style that closely resembles EHRs used in emergency departments in Sweden. In the pilot phase, we collected a first batch of 50 artificial EHRs, which has passed review by an experienced Swedish emergency care physician. We make this dataset publicly available as OpenChart-SE corpus (version 1) under an open-source license for the NLP research community. The project is now open for general participation and Swedish physicians and medical students are invited to submit EHRs on the project website (https://github.com/Aitslab/openchart-se). Additional batches of quality-controlled EHRs will be released periodically.
    
        Researcher: Salma Kazemi Rashed,Rafsan Ahmed,Johan Frid,Sonja Aits. Research: Here we present a toolbox for natural language processing tasks related to SARS-CoV-2. It comprises English dictionaries of synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, a silver standard corpus generated with the dictionaries and a gold standard corpus of 10 Pubmed abstracts manually annotated for disease, virus, symptom and protein/gene terms. This toolbox is freely available on github and can be used for text analytics in a variety of settings related to the COVID-19 crisis. It will be expanded and applied in NLP tasks over the next weeks and the community is invited to contribute.
    
        Researcher: Oscar Kjell,Katarina Kjell,Sverker Sikström,Danilo Garcia. Research: Semantic measures: Using natural language processing to measure, differentiate, and describe psychological constructs
    
        Researcher: Per Runeson,Magnus Alexandersson,Oskar Nyholm. Research: Defect reports are generated from various testing and development activities in software engineering. Some-times two reports are submitted that describe the same problem, leading to duplicate reports. These reports are mostly written in structured natural language, and as such, it is hard to compare two reports for similarity with formal methods. In order to identify duplicates, we investigate using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to support the identification. A prototype tool is developed and evaluated in a case study analyzing defect reports at Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. The evaluation shows that about 2/3 of the duplicates can possibly be found using the NLP techniques. Different variants of the techniques provide only minor result differences, indicating a robust technology. User testing shows that the overall attitude towards the technique is positive and that it has a growth potential. © 2007 IEEE.
