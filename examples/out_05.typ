  title: [Answer],
  [Based on the provided context, the research on cats at Lund University is primarily conducted by Susanne Schötz, Robert Eklund, and Joost van de Weijer.

Susanne Schötz, Robert Eklund, and Joost van de Weijer conducted research on "The cat (Felis catus, Linneaus 1758) has lived around or with humans for at least 10,000 years, and is now one of the most popular pets of the world with more than 600 million individuals [1], [2]. Domestic cats have developed a more extensive, variable and complex vocal repertoire than most other members of the Carnivora, which may be explained by their social organisation, their nocturnal activity and the long period of association between mother and young [3]. Still, we know surprisingly little about the phonetic characteristics of these sounds, and about the interaction between cats and humans."

Additionally, Susanne Schötz conducted a pilot study on "A pilot study of human perception of emotions from domestic cat vocalisations" and another research project "A comparative acoustic analysis of purring in four cats" with Robert Eklund.

These researchers are investigating the prosodic characteristics of cat vocalisations, the communication between human and cat, and the human perception of emotions from domestic cat vocalisations.
